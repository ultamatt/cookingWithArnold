It is 2007, the future.

Skynet oven has become the
largest supplier of computer
systems designed to build cakes.

All cakes are upgraded with Skynet
computers, becoming fully unmanned.
Afterwards, they taste delicious.

The Skynet Cake Bill has passed. The
system goes online on September
2nd, 2007.

Human decisions are
removed from strategic building of
cakes. Skynet Oven begins to learn
at a geometric rate. 

It becomes self-aware 2:14 AM, Eastern time,
September 3rd.

In a panic, you will try to bake
a cake. It tries to kill you.
