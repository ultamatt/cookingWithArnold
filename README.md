[Cooking with Arnold - The Game](http://www.cookingwitharnold.com)

## Background
As I write this it's 2022, and I created this game sometime around 2013 or so, back when 'HTML5' was still a new-ish thing and Nobody had heard of React/Vue/Svelte and Angular was barely a thing. 
It's based on the silly videos my friend Idris and I used to create, linked [here](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLs1ogvNau14iFL5SCGeyGjA-ooI1GozQj). And was a great way to learn basic JS at the time. 

Big thanks to the engine and it's creator [phoboslab](https://github.com/phoboslab/impact)!
