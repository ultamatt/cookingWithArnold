Cooking with Arnold - The Game

## Background
As I write this it's 2022, and I created this game sometime around 2013 or so, back when 'HTML5' was still a new-ish thing and Nobody had heard of React/Vue/Svelte and Angular was barely a thing. 
It's based on the silly videos my friend Idris and I used to create, linked below. And was a great way to learn basic JS at the time.
